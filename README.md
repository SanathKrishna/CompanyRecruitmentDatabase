# CompanyRecruitmentDatabase
The following project is the execution of a recruitment database used in a company. The project uses SQL queries to define and implement the database. 
The following project implements the HR department of a company that looks after the screening and recruitment process of candidates. 
To make this project more efficient, I have used available database concepts like Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Functions, Transactions, Security Roles and other User-Defined Functions.
Database design of my project is taken care by using Entity Relationship diagram.
